A [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) integration that aggregates data from up to three Huawei solar monitoring integrations — **Huawei Solar** (local Modbus), **FusionSolar** (Kiosk/OpenAPI) and **FusionSolarPlus** — into a single, stable set of `sensor.hf_hub_*` entities with automatic priority-based failover.

> **Why this exists:** the local Modbus connection ([Huawei Solar](https://github.com/wlcrs/huawei_solar)) is the most reactive and accurate source, but occasionally drops. The cloud sources ([FusionSolar](https://github.com/tijsverkoyen/HomeAssistant-FusionSolar), [FusionSolarPlus](https://github.com/JortvanSchijndel/FusionSolarPlus)) are more resilient but slower. This hub sits in front of all three and always serves the best available value — so your automations keep running regardless of which source is up.

---

## ⚠️ Important notes

- This integration **does not communicate directly** with your inverter or any cloud service. It only reads entity states already published in Home Assistant by the source integrations — zero extra polling.
- At least one of the three source integrations must be installed and configured. The hub works with any combination of one, two or all three.
- Entity discovery is **language-independent**: matching is done on registry `unique_id` values (register names for Huawei Solar, numeric signal ids for FusionSolarPlus, sensor ids for FusionSolar), so the hub works regardless of your Home Assistant language or any renamed entities.
- Unofficial project, not affiliated with Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.

## Features

- **Priority-based failover**: for every quantity, the hub uses the highest-priority source that is currently available. Priority is configurable from the UI at any time — including adding or removing sources.
- **221 canonical sensors** — the complete union of quantities from all three sources, including single-source entities. Sensors are grouped into logical devices: **Inverter**, **Battery**, **Battery Unit 1/2**, **Power Meter** and **Plant**.
- **Stable entity IDs**: automations and dashboards keep working regardless of which source is active. Every hub sensor exposes `source` and `source_entity` attributes so you always know where the value is coming from.
- **Automatic unit normalization**: values are converted to canonical units (W, kWh, °C) even when sources report differently (kW vs W, Wh vs kWh).
- **Dynamic rediscovery**: when a source integration is added or re-enabled, the hub automatically discovers and creates the new hub entities — no restart needed — and notifies you with grouped counts.
- **Source availability alerts**: a `binary_sensor` per source (connectivity device class), an event on the bus (`huawei_fusion_hub_source_offline` / `_online`), and configurable persistent notifications when a source goes down or recovers.
- **Initial summary notification**: on first setup, a persistent notification reports how many entities were created, grouped per device and per source.
- **Optional control aggregation**: switch and select entities (inverter on/off, battery working mode, charge from grid…) can be proxied through the hub — off by default, with the rationale explained in the config flow.
- **Native entity categories**: measurements, Diagnostic (statuses, identifiers) and Configuration (control proxies) are separated in each device page, mirroring the source integrations' layout.
- **Multi-language**: UI and entity names in English and Italian.

## Installation

### Via HACS (recommended)

1. HACS → Integrations → ⋮ menu → **Custom repositories**
2. Add `https://github.com/naked-head/huawei-fusion-hub`, category **Integration**
3. Search for "Huawei Fusion Hub" and install
4. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual

1. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/naked-head/huawei-fusion-hub/releases/latest)
2. Copy `custom_components/huawei_fusion_hub` into `/config/custom_components/`
3. Restart Home Assistant

---

## Requirements

At least one of the following integrations must be installed and configured before adding the hub:

- [Huawei Solar](https://github.com/wlcrs/huawei_solar) — local Modbus, highest accuracy and frequency
- [FusionSolar](https://github.com/tijsverkoyen/HomeAssistant-FusionSolar) — cloud Kiosk or Northbound API
- [FusionSolarPlus](https://github.com/JortvanSchijndel/FusionSolarPlus) — cloud, direct credentials

---

## Configuration

1. **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → Huawei Fusion Hub**
2. **Select sources**: installed integrations are auto-detected and pre-selected. You can select any combination.
3. **Set priority** (if more than one source): order the sources — the hub always tries the first available one.
4. **Aggregate control entities** (optional, off by default): choose whether switch/select controls should also be proxied through the hub. Controls exist only on the Modbus connection, so they gain no failover — the step explains the trade-off before you decide.

### Changing sources or priority

Open the integration's three-dot menu → **Configure** (Options) at any time to:
- **Add or remove** source integrations
- **Change the priority order**
- **Enable or disable control aggregation**
- **Toggle disconnect notifications**

No restart is needed when changing options.

## Exposed entities

The hub exposes **221 canonical sensors** grouped into logical devices. The full correspondence table between hub entities and source entities is in **[ENTITY_MAP.md](ENTITY_MAP.md)**.

| Device | Entities |
|---|---|
| Inverter | 38 — active/reactive power, voltages, currents, yields, temperature, efficiency, PV strings… |
| Power Meter | 28 — active/reactive power, frequencies, grid import/export energy, per-phase measurements… |
| Battery | 14 — SoC, charge/discharge power, daily/total energy, bus voltage/current, status… |
| Battery Unit 1 | 62 — unit-level and per-pack (3 packs): voltage, power, SoC, temperatures, discharge energy… |
| Battery Unit 2 | 61 — same as Unit 1 |
| Plant | 18 — realtime power, daily/monthly/yearly/total energy, consumption, self-consumption ratios, flows… |
| Controls (opt-in) | 6 — switch/select proxies: inverter on/off, charge from grid, MPPT scanning, battery working mode, excess PV use, capacity control |

A hub sensor is created only when at least one configured source provides that quantity. Sensors only available from a single source have no failover but keep a stable entity name.

The FusionSolar column of the map covers both **Kiosk** mode (plant-level sensors) and **Northbound/OpenAPI** mode (per-device realtime data), so the hub takes full advantage of an OpenAPI account when available.

## Automation example

Alert when the local Modbus connection drops and the hub falls back to cloud:

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Huawei Solar offline"
    triggers:
      - trigger: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.hf_hub_huawei_solar_available
        to: "off"
        for: "00:02:00"
    actions:
      - action: notify.mobile_app_phone
        data:
          message: "Huawei Solar (Modbus) is offline — hub is now using cloud fallback."
```

Or use the event bus directly for more granular control:

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Hub source changed"
    triggers:
      - trigger: event
        event_type: huawei_fusion_hub_source_offline
    actions:
      - action: notify.mobile_app_phone
        data:
          message: "{{ trigger.event.data.name }} went offline."
```

## Source availability

A source is marked offline when more than 80% of its mapped entities are `unavailable` or `unknown`. This threshold avoids false positives when only a single entity is temporarily missing.
